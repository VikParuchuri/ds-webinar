* Lots of great speakers/talks so far
* Going to talk about something slightly different -- education
* Take a step back into history
* Why is learning ML important?
    * Insert stuff about autopilot
        * Computer hysteria, etc
        * Y2k bug?
        * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot
    * What changed?
        * Broader awareness of computers
    * Pyramid, with multiple levels
        * Researchers
        * System makers
        * People who apply
        * People who interpret
        * People who consume/use
    * People interact with computers more, are more familiar with them
        * Probably take computer classes in school/know someone who codes
    * Insert stuff about AI ending the world
        * AI hysteria, etc
    * Automated essay scoring controversy at edX
        * Already been used since the 1970s
    * Having more interpreters or a larger pyramid could have fixed the problem
    * Machine learning term first coined in 1959 
        * "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" -- Arthur Samuel 
        * "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E" -- Tom Mitchell
    * AI pretty old
        * Automaton myths in old societies
        * Gained fashion in 1950's
        * Things like Turk even older -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk
    * Lots of optimism in the 60's
        * "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being."  -- Minsky
    * Optimism overstated, led to removal of funding
    * Perceptrons ignored for 10 years because of criticism in the research community
    * Most AI success comes from when different approaches/styles are combined (much like breakout success in any field)
    * We aren't yet at the point where we have a well-developed pyramid
        * Show some data about machine learning pyramid
    * Show programming vs machine learning
    * So how do we make machine learning less "scary"?
    * Lower barriers to entry
    * Education + better/simpler tooling
        * Education important because:
            * Not everyone wants to actually perform machine learning -- some just curious
            * If all we do is lower barriers to entry, who builds the tools?
                * Universities will probably fill a lot of this role, but others can as well.
    * Huge uptick in machine learning interest after AI class
        * Good for everyone
    * Deep learning trend caused by increase in researchers and appliers -- need more interpreters
    * How do we make AI benefit society?
        * http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf
* How to teach/learn machine learning?
    * Vik's story
        * Was a diplomat
        * Wanted to predict the stock market
        * Learned coding
        * Hit limits of simple rule-based systems
        * Found Kaggle
        * Competed and did well in first competition
            * Studied stats, linear algebra, etc
            * Read many papers
            * First method pretty bad -- basically linear regression with some nonlinear "correction"
        * Found the competition bug, kept doing competitions
        * Took bits of a few MOOCs
    * Types of online learning
        * Blended learning can be better than in-person
            * http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED505824
        * Students take MOOCs primarily because of curiosity
            * People who interacted with others outside of class did much better
            * 52% of certificate earners active in the forum, 3% of everyone else
            * http://mooc.pku.edu.cn/source/resource/01.pdf
        * People take MOOCs due to curiosity and to advance in their jobs
            * http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2350964
        * MOOC benefits -- immediate feedback
            * Self-paced nature good
            * Students prefer to interact with local peers
            * http://jolt.merlot.org/vol9no2/bruff_0613.htm
            * Problem online is "many readers, few contributors"
* How to make online learning better
    * Improved openness
        * OER/open source materials
    * Lower barriers to entry
    * Bridge application and learning

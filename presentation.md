# Dataquest

* In-browser data science tutorials
* Learn theory + application

---
# How I got started

* BA in American History
* Learned using online resources

---
# The problem

* Learning about data science is a nebulous process that isn't aligned with application

---
# What is data science?

* Relatively new term
* Intersection of many fields

---
# Increasing specialization

* Data engineer
* Data analyst
* Machine learning engineer

---
# DS is about solving problems

* Have to learn by doing

---
# Entry level job/project-readiness

* Basic algo skills
* "The rest"

---
# Application

* Data cleaning 90% of work
* Tradeoffs when applying algorithms

---
# Communication

* Explaining results
* Working with other teams

---
# Systems

* Writing faster-running code
* Scaling to multiple machines

---
# Programming

* Writing well-structured code
* Testing

---
# Traditional ways to teach

* MOOCs
* Lectures

---
# What not to do: videos

* Great if you want to be entertained
* Can't learn anything unless you're solving problems

----
# What not to do: "syntax only"

* If you just learn syntax, you won't be able to transfer skills
* Critically important to learn how to think

----
# What not to do: only follow guided tutorials

* Need to work on projects
* Have to take off the training wheels

---
# What not to do: learn with multiple languages

* Highly recommend python
* Get very comfortable/good with one language first

---
# How should you learn?

---
# Step 1: Learn to code

* Python! (hopefully)
* Go to programming meetups
* Work on projects
* Go to hackathons

----
# Step 2: Learn to work with data

* Find datasets.
    * UCI machine learning repository
    * Census.gov
    * Reddit /r/datasets
* Answer questions with the data
* Think about what/how you might predict
* Go to data science meetups

---
# Step 3: Start with applied ML

* Get familiar with implementing linear regression
    * Scikit-learn docs
* Go to machine learning meetups
* Work on a project
* Progressively add pieces (error measurement, cross validation, etc)

---
# Step 4: More application, and some theory

* Write blog posts, speak at meetups, and put projects on github
* Consult
* Learn statistics
* Learn linear algebra
* Learn more algorithms (knn/k-means/logistic regression)

---
# Step 5: Get better at coding

* Unit test your algorithms
* Learn some basic computer science (sorting/search/etc)
* Refactor old code
* Get better at bash scripting

---
# Step 6: Broaden the scope

* Keep working on projects
* Learn a couple more algorithms
* Work on larger datasets
* Learn about hardware, storage, and networking

---
# How long will this take?

* Ongoing process
* 6 months to a couple of years upfront
* Things change quickly

---
# How Dataquest can help

* Teaches fundamentals, not syntax
* Focuses on real-world datasets
* Adding in mentorship features
* Adding in projects

# Quick survey

---
# How I got started with ML

## Bachelors in American History
## Learned using online resources

---
# ML + Online education

## > 100k students in Andrew Ng's first class
## Dozens more MOOCs from intro to advanced neural nets

---
# The expanding field of machine learning

## 200% job growth, per indeed.com

---
# Growth across the board

## McKinsey -- in 2018 the US will have a data scientist shortage
    * 190,000 data scientists
    * 1.5 million managers and analysts

---
# Machine learning pyramid

## Researchers
## Framework developers
## Appliers
## Interpreters
## Consumers

---
# The lower layers are important

## Two "AI Winters"
    * Hype
    * Inability to adapt products to the market
## Elon Musk (and others) -- "AI is an existential threat"
    
---
# edX automated essay scoring

## Too much hype
## Negative public reaction -- lack of interpretation

---
# So...how does someone learn machine learning?

## Standard answer: stats, linear algebra, read books, take moocs

---
# Very little follow-through

## Hint: we can make this better!

---
# MOOCs

## Wide variety of high quality courses
## Can be near the cutting edge

---
# MOOCs

## Hard to filter
## Not always application focused
## Lots of prerequisites

---
# MOOCs

## Great for deepening learning
## Not the best for introduction, or application

---
# Textbooks

## Information can be taken in quickly
## Self paced

---
# Textbooks

## Hard to find help
## Hard to stay motivated
## Dense terminology

---
# Kaggle

## Way to try lots of techniques
## Good discussion forum
## Competition

---
# Kaggle

## Competition
## Hard to know where to start

---
# Problem: Bias

## Most people who made it through are self-motivated
## Or went through universities
## In most cases, both

---
# Problem: quickly evolving field

## Hard to know what someone needs
## Lower layers less defined
## Machine learning becoming a "destination"

---
# Result

## Many turned off of machine learning
## Kaggle + courses turn into a prefilter
    * Select people with certain personalities
## "Machine learning" on resume != "Can do machine learning"

---
# Reality 

## For most people ML work is 5-10% algorithms
## Very few people at the top of the pyramid

---
# Entry level job/project-readiness

## Basic algo skills
## "The rest"

---
# So why do we focus on the 5%?

## University-driven
## Just starting to need other roles
## Harder to teach other things

---
# Why do we get unrealistic recommendations?

## Top people in the field tend to answer
## Many job postings are unrealistic

---
# Perpetuates a myth

## Either a beginner or at the top

---
# How do we improve?

## Focus on application/practical skills!
## Emphasize peer interactions

---
# Discussion = good

## Educational research shows blended learning very effective
## Discussion activity correlates with high course performance

---
# Bootcamps have an opportunity

## Right now, many give a broad survey of multiple algorithms
## Focus on a few

---
# ML = Motivation

## First steps are semi-magical

---
# How to sustain motivation?

## Recognize that everyone has different on and off ramps
## Make better tools
    * Educational
    * Applied
    
---
# Better applied tools

## Lower barriers
## But, can someone using a turnkey solution explain what the model means?
## How do you refine or make a model better?

---
# Better educational tools

## Cohesive (no "transition" points)
## Quick feedback
## Well-designed

---
# High schoolers

## 2 high schools on dataquest
## Very good results
## Next step: teach ML

---
# So...how should you learn?

---
# The whole spectrum

## Programming
## Data munging
## Scaling systems
## Interpretation/communication

---
# Step 1: Learn to code

* If you don't know a language yet, try Python.
* Go to local programming meetups.  Make friends.
* Work on projects.

----
# Step 2: Learn to work with data

* Find datasets.
    * UCI machine learning repository is good
    * So is census.gov
    * And stock data
* Answer interesting questions with the data
* Think about how you might predict things
* Go to data science meetups.  Make more friends.

---
# Step 3: Start with applied ML

* Get familiar with implementing linear regression
    * Look at documentation, like `scikit-learn`
* Go to machine learning meetups.  Make even more friends.
* Work on a project to implement linear regression.
* Progressively add pieces (error measurement, cross validation, etc)

---
# Step 4: More application, and some theory

* Find progressively harder problems.
* Write blog posts, speak at meetups, and put projects on github
* Learn statistics
    * Make your regression projects better

---
# Step 5: More theory

* Keep working on projects
* Learn a couple more algorithms
* Work on larger datasets

---
# How long will this take?

* Depends on the learner -- anywhere from 6 months to even longer.

---
# Wrapping up

## How can we teach machine learning to people across the pyramid?
## Can we enable better peer interactions?
## How can we reach people earlier on?

---
# Done!

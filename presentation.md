# Quick survey

---
# Four questions

* How do we get more people into ML?
* How do we improve people's skills once they get in?
* How do we vertically grow machine learning?
* How do people prove what they know?

---
# Getting more people in

## Huge strides in past few years
## > 100k students in Andrew Ng's first class

---
# How I got started with ML

## Bachelors in American History
## Learned using online resources

---
# MOOCs/Textbooks

* Wide variety of high quality material
* Great for deepening learning
* Hard to filter
* Not always application focused

---
# Kaggle

* Way to try lots of techniques
* Good discussion forum
* Competition
* Hard to know where to start

---
# So...how does someone learn machine learning?

## Standard answer: stats, linear algebra, read books, take moocs
## Very few make it through

---
# So you want to work on this stuff, huh?

---
# Application

## Applied side very important, especially starting out
## Data cleaning 90% of the work

---
# Communication

## Explaining results
## Working with other teams

--
# Systems

## Writing faster-running code
## Scaling to multiple machines

---
# Why aren't we teaching this stuff?

## Harder + Less interesting to teach
## Seen as an industry problem

---
# Problem: Bias

## Most people who made it through are self-motivated
## Or went through universities
## In most cases, both

---
# Problem: quickly evolving field

## Hard to know what someone needs
## Machine learning becoming a "destination"

---
# Result

## Many turned off of machine learning
## Kaggle + courses turn into a personality prefilter
## "Machine learning" on resume != "Can do machine learning"

---
# Machine learning pyramid

## Researchers
## Framework developers
## Appliers
## Interpreters
## Consumers

---
# The lower layers are important

## Two "AI Winters"
    * Hype
    * Inability to adapt products to the market
## Elon Musk (and others) -- "AI is an existential threat"
    
---
# edX automated essay scoring

## Too much hype
## Negative public reaction

---
# Why don't we focus on other layers?

## Roles just being defined
## Top people in the field tend to answer
## Many job postings are unrealistic

---
# Perpetuates a myth

## Either a beginner or at the top
## Have to know everything about everything

---
# Machine learning is about solving problems

---
# Entry level job/project-readiness

## Basic algo skills
## "The rest"

---
# How do we improve?

## Focus on application/practical skills!
## Emphasize peer interactions

---
# Discussion = good

## Educational research shows blended learning very effective
## Discussion activity correlates with high course performance

---
# ML = Motivation

## First steps are semi-magical

---
# How to sustain motivation?

## Recognize that everyone has different on and off ramps
## Make better tools
    * Educational
    * Applied

---
# High schoolers

## 2 high schools on dataquest
## Very good results
## Next step: teach ML

---
# So...how should you learn or improve?

---
# The whole spectrum

## Programming
## Data munging
## Scaling systems
## Interpretation/communication

---
# Step 1: Learn to code

* If you don't know a language yet, try Python.
* Go to local programming meetups.  Make friends.
* Work on projects.
* Go to hackathons.

----
# Step 2: Learn to work with data

* Find datasets.
    * UCI machine learning repository is good
    * So is census.gov
    * And stock data
    * And reddit /r/datasets
* Answer interesting questions with the data
* Think about how you might predict things
* Go to data science meetups.  Make more friends.

---
# Step 3: Start with applied ML

* Get familiar with implementing linear regression
    * Look at documentation, like `scikit-learn`
* Go to machine learning meetups.  Make even more friends.
* Work on a project to implement linear regression.
* Progressively add pieces (error measurement, cross validation, etc)

---
# Step 4: More application, and some theory

* Find progressively harder problems.
* Write blog posts, speak at meetups, and put projects on github
* Do some consulting
* Learn statistics
    * Make your regression projects better

---
# Step 5: More theory

* Keep working on projects
* Learn a couple more algorithms
* Work on larger datasets

---
# Quick weekend hack

* Unite -- cooperative machine learning
* https://github.com/dataquestio/unite

---
# How long will this take?

* Ongoing process
* Initial steps 6 months to a couple of years
* But things change quickly

---
# Wrapping up

## How can we teach machine learning to people across the pyramid?
## Can we enable better peer interactions?
## How can we reach people earlier on?

---
# Done!

# How I got started with ML

* BA in American History
* Learned using online resources

---
# Quick survey

---
# The problem

* Learning about machine learning is a nebulous process that isn't aligned with application

---
# The result

* Many turned away
* Important skills not emphasized

---
# Questions to answer in this talk

* What do I tell someone who wants to learn?
* How do I improve my skills?

---
# Getting more people in

* Huge strides in past few years
* > 100k students in Andrew Ng's first MOOC

---
# MOOCs

* Great material
* Good for deepening learning
* Hard to filter
* Not always application focused

---
# Kaggle

* Try lots of techniques
* Good discussion forum
* Competition
* Appeals to a certain personality

---
# How does someone learn machine learning?

* Standard answer: stats, linear algebra, read books, take moocs

---
# Many different roles

* Researchers
* Framework developers
* Appliers
* Interpreters
* Consumers

---
# Interpreters/consumers important

* Two "AI Winters"
    * Hype
    * Few consumer products
* Elon Musk (and others) -- "AI is an existential threat"
    
---
# edX automated essay scoring

* Hype
* Negative reaction

---
# Learning applied ML

---
# ML is about solving problems

---
# Entry level job/project-readiness

* Basic algo skills
* "The rest"

---
# Application

* Data cleaning 90% of work
* Tradeoffs when applying algorithms

---
# Communication

* Explaining results
* Working with other teams

---
# Systems

* Writing faster-running code
* Scaling to multiple machines

---
# Programming

* Writing well-structured code
* Testing

---
# Why aren't we teaching this stuff?

* Harder + less interesting to teach
* Industry problem

---
# Bias

* Advice-givers too far from beginning
* Not everyone wants to get to the same place

---
# Quickly evolving field

* Roles ill-defined
* ML a "destination"

---
# Perpetuates a myth

* Either a beginner or at the top
* Have to know everything about everything

---
# Result

* Many turned off of ML
* Kaggle + courses are a personality filter
    * Reduces diversity
* ML on resume != Can do ML

---
# How to motivate learning?

* Everyone has different on and off ramps
* Better tools
    * Educational
    * Applied
    
---
# ML has intrinsic motivation

* First steps are semi-magical

---
# You can even motivate high schoolers!

* 2 high schools on dataquest
* Good results
* Next step: teach ML

---
# Groups increase motivation

* Blended learning effective
* Correlates with high course completion

---
# How should you learn or improve?

---
# Step 1: Learn to code

* If you don't know a language yet, try Python
* Go to programming meetups
* Work on projects
* Go to hackathons

----
# Step 2: Learn to work with data

* Find datasets.
    * UCI machine learning repository
    * Census.gov
    * Reddit /r/datasets
* Answer questions with the data
* Think about what/how you might predict
* Go to data science meetups

---
# Step 3: Start with applied ML

* Get familiar with implementing linear regression
    * Scikit-learn docs
* Go to machine learning meetups
* Work on a project
* Progressively add pieces (error measurement, cross validation, etc)

---
# Step 4: More application, and some theory

* Write blog posts, speak at meetups, and put projects on github
* Consult
* Learn statistics
* Learn linear algebra
* Learn more algorithms (knn/k-means/logistic regression)

---
# Step 5: Get better at coding

* Unit test your algorithms
* Learn some basic computer science (sorting/search/etc)
* Refactor old code
* Get better at bash scripting

---
# Step 6: Broaden the scope

* Keep working on projects
* Learn a couple more algorithms
* Work on larger datasets
* Learn about hardware, storage, and networking

---
# Quick weekend hack

* Unite -- cooperative machine learning
* https://github.com/dataquestio/unite

---
# How long will this take?

* Ongoing process
* 6 months to a couple of years upfront
* Things change quickly

---
# Contributing

* We can all make better tools
* No better time to learn or teach ML

---
# Done!
